feat: integrate sandbox flag into CLI and config chain

Adds --sandbox flag integration throughout the CLI and MCP server:
- Add sandbox field to RunAsyncConfig and RunInteractiveConfig
- Add sandbox field to MCPServerConfig
- Pass sandbox flag from CLI through to MCP server initialization
- Fix clippy warnings in linux-sandbox library (empty doc lines, manual strip, Default impl)
- Add sandbox parameter to all MCPServerConfig instantiations

The sandbox flag is now passed through the entire config chain but not yet
enforced at command execution. This is the groundwork for applying kernel
restrictions when the flag is enabled.

Note: Sandbox enforcement at tool execution (execute_local_command) is
still pending and will be implemented in a follow-up commit.
