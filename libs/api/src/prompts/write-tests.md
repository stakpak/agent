2. **Edge cases** - Boundary conditions, empty inputs, max values
3. **Error cases** - Invalid inputs, failure scenarios
4. **Integration points** - Mock external dependencies appropriately

Guidelines:
- Follow the existing test patterns in the codebase
- Use descriptive test names that explain the scenario
- Keep tests focused and independent
